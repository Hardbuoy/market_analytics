## Required software

#### Web browser: 
- Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome, or Microsoft Edge.

 ### Web server:
A web server is a software application intended to store and serve web pages. It also enables the execution of   server-side code. For this project, we use the WAMP Server (users of macOS can use MAMP Server). Download and install it keeping all the default configuration values. If you get an error message indicating that the installation cannot continue because of missing VC++ packages, download and install the required packages from this link, and try again to install with the default configuration.

Once the WAMP server is installed, it is necessary to configure it to enable the execution of Python scripts. You will always need to restart the service after making changes to its configuration.

Open the file httpd.conf. In a default installation, this file is located in c:\wamp64\bin\apache\apache2.4.58\conf\httpd.conf. Look for the line highlighted in 1 and modify it as shown in 2.
